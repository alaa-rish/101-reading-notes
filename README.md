# How you can benefit from a growth mindset
![Mindset](https://i1.wp.com/atlassianblog.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/growth-mindset.png?w=1101&ssl=1)

The growth mindset can improve your life and open new pathway to move forward, push you for a higher goals.

#### What is a growth mindset?

A growth mindset stimulate your life with continuais achivments and  makes you in love with learning more and more.


By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort.


***Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:***

## Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset
* **Challenges**
Here’s an example of when I wasn’t in the right mindset: Moving forward without sharing. I started my own projects without sharing the results with mentors and audiance to get feedback. i found that is hard to keep going and get a higher results.



* **obstacles**
I was using my own knowledge without looking for new mentors in many levels. My first impulse when I hit a roadblock is to immediately divert my attention to something else. Changing and starting again in the same way without moving forward and talk to a new mentor makes me feel like i'm moving in a circles every time.



* **Effort**
I have similar troubles with cycling. When my alarm goes off at 5 A.M., the thought of going out on the bike is dreadful. The temptation to stay in bed is strong, strong, strong – curse you, instant gratification monkey – but I also know the feeling won’t last and I’ll feel guilty later, as always. The trite-but-true phrase “no pain, no gain” is pure growth mindset!



* **Criticism**
I also find it useful to review each of my days and assess how I’ve done. As I mentioned at the beginning, I often judge my days based on my mood at the end. My worst days are when I haven’t managed to get things together, I’ve procrastinated and wasted time, and I find myself with very little to look back on positively.

So I’ve learned to ask myself two questions:

* What was the best part of the day?
* What went wrong, and how can I make sure it doesn’t happen again?



* **Success of others**
For a long time, I was fiercely jealous of people I thought were more successful or more intelligent. But, with the help of our culture of openness and honesty, I was able to understand how the work I do relates to the work of my peers, and how it all comes together to create something awesome.
So, where I once perceived those I deemed smarter as adversaries, I now see them as dedicated colleagues with a passion for learning. Where I once saw (and was jealous of) more successful managers, I now see peers with skills that complement mine, and together we’re doing some of the best work of our lives. You see, this is the growth mindset at its finest. Where a fixed mindset leads you to see the success of others as a threat, the growth mindset encourages you to see the success of coworkers as an inspiration. See, I told you it was cool.



### Growing at work, and outside work too
I’ve been guilty of having a fixed mindset far too often, and I’m working to change that. Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it. We live in a society where the instant gratification monkey sits on everyone’s shoulder. But the pleasures that result from determination and hard work far outweigh anything that devilish chimp has to offer. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective.
Maybe all this seems obvious to you, in which case, you’re lucky. For me, I’ve found that taking the time to assess what I’m doing is tremendously effective in keeping me on track at work. When I feel myself losing focus, I try to remember that short-term frustration will likely result in long-term improvement of my abilities – if I just stay with it. A growth mindset opens me up to more creativity and possibility, and I discover I’m able to achieve more and set higher goals.
